    <string name="traid">\n “TRIAD” \n\n A computer system can be defined as a TRIAD comprising of three fundamental components:\n
(1) The CPU (2) The Memory and (3) The I/O \n\n
These three devices communicates with each other with the help of a set of wires called System Bus,
where the System Bus comprises of three buses as –\n
1. The Address Bus\n
2. The Data Bus and\n
3. The Control Bus.\n\n
A computer system requires an interface with the user to execute a program. The interaction is
accomplished with the help of I/O devices. (The Input – Output subsystem of a computer, referred to
as I/O, provides an efficient mode of communication between the central system and the outside
environment).\n\n</string>
    <string name="IOheading"><u><b>Input – Output Architecture</b></u> \n\n
A computer system organization is defined as a collection of component connected together in a
logical sense, i.e. the logical structure of a computer system is termed computer organization.
The collection of physical component such as CPU, Memory, I/O arranged constitutes computer
architecture. Thus the physical definition of the system is architecture.
\n\n
Organization = Logical\n
Architecture = Physical\n\n</string>
    <string name="systemHeading">\nThe I/O devices are connected to an entity called an interface (I/F) to have
            an interaction with the system.\n\n</string>
    <string name="organisation">\n
     <u>  <b>Organization and Architecture→</b></u> \n\n
In describing computer system, a distinction is often made between computer architecture and
computer organization. Computer architecture refers to those attributes of a system visible to a
programmer or put another way, those attributes that have a direct impact on the logical execution
of a program. Computer organization refers to the operational units and their interconnections that
realize the architectural specifications. Example of architectural attributes include the instruction
set, the number of bits used to represent various data types (e.g. numbers, characters), I/O
mechanisms, and techniques for addressing memories. Organizational attributes include those
hardware details transparent to the programmer, such as control signals, interface between the
computer and peripherals and the memory technology used.
Register transfer language\n
A digital system is an interconnection of digital hardware modules combined together to
perform a specific processing task. The modules are constructed using registers ,decoders,
arithmetic elements and control logic. These various modules are interconnected with
common data and control paths to form a digital computer system.\n
A digital module can be best defined as the register it contains and the operations that are
performed on the data stored in them. The operations executed on data stored in registers
are called micro operations. A micro-operation is defined as an elementary operation
carried out on one clock pulse, over the information stored in one or more registers.eg.
shift, count, clear load.\n
The organization of a digital computer can be best defined by:\n
1)The set of registers it contains and their function\n
2)sequence of micro-operations performed on the data stored in the registers\n
3)control functions that initiate the sequence of micro-operations.\n
The symbolic notations used to describe the micro-operation transfers among registers is
called a register transfer language. As a programming language is a procedure for writing
symbols to specify a given computational process similarly a register transfer language ia a
system for expressing the micro-operation sequences in a symbolical form among the
registers of a digital module. Unlike a programming language; a register transfer language is
directly related to and cannot be separated from the registers and other hardware that it
defines.\n\n
\n\n<u><b>INTER-REGISTER TRANSFER</b></u>
Data transfer among registers is accomplished by means of inter-register transfer microoperations. These micro-operations perform a direct transfer of binary information from
one register to another. The destination register receives the information from the source
register retaining the contents in source register.\n
Information transfer from one register to the another can be performed either in parallel or
in serial.\n\n
        <u><b>Parallel transfer</b></u>\n\n
Parallel transfer is a simultaneous transfer of all bits from the source register to destination
register and is accomplished during one clock pulse. This micro-operation is designated in
symbolic form as follows:\n\n
A←B\n\n
And denotes a transfer of the content of register B into register A.The binary function which
determines when this transfer will take place is called a control function.A control function
is a binary function that is it can be either equal to 0 or 1.Thus the modified symbology for
the above transfer can be written as\n\n
P:A←B\n\n
The control function P symbolizes the fact that the stated micro-operation is executed by
the hardware only if P=1.\n</string>

    what is computer Graphics\n
computer graphics is use of computer to define store manipulate,
introgate  and present the pictorial output
                          OR\n

computer graphics means creation,storage and manipulation of models come
from many fields incuding physical ,mathematical,artistics and biological structure\n

<b><u>Types:-</u></b>\n
        *Interactive computer graphics +++++++)) a two way communication between the computer
and the user ,where the observer is given some control over the image by providing
an input device example video games  \n\n

        <b>* Non -Interactive computer graphics (passive computer graphics)-</b>\n
here  the user does not have any kind of control over the image .
the image is product of static stored program and will work according to
the instructions given in the program .here the image is totally
under the control of program intruction not under the user
Example - screensaver.
\n\n

        <u>pixel:-</u> the smallest addressable screen element or smallest addresabale area which we can
can control on the screen at some point of time is called pixel
\n\n
<u>Resolution:- </u>the number of pointss that can be displayed without
overlapping each other on the screen is defined as resolution
\n\n\
It is also defines the quality of graphics
        \n
Aspect ratio :- it is a ratio of vertical lenght by horizontal length
of any object in term of the number of pixel persent

    <string name="second_segment_workstation_graphics">-it is a graphical kernal system (gks) term for a graphical
device that can display graphical output and accept graphical
input\n
-It consists of cpu ,display,processer ,memory,display device
,recoder,plotter,keyboard,mouse,scanner,etc..\n
-Thev main hardware component of a graphics workstation are
cpu and display processor.\n
-The display processor is also called graphics controller or a
a diplay co-processor.\n
-It makes cpu free from the graphical work.\n
-In addition to the system memory a seperate display procesor
 memory area is provided.\n
- The graphical workstation have a provision to interface
videogame and television set\n
- They also have display devices with very high resolution and
veru high performance cpu.\n
-The graphical workstation is always supported with graphical
software\n

Framebuffer-\n\n
A frame buffer is a secondary memory buffer used to construct a video frame before it is displayed on a
screem surface.\n

# It is an area of memory used to hold the frame of data that
 is continusly being send to the screen .\n
# The buffer is the size of maximum image that can be displayed and
  may be a seprate memory bank on the graphics card or a reserved part of regular
memory.\n
        #framebuffer is represented by an array which collects and store the intensity value
for all the pixel\n
# This array is accesed by the display device to determine the intensity at which 
each pixel should be displayed\n
         Therefor, a frame buffer contains internal representation of pixel
